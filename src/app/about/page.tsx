        The Disruptors Den is a dynamic community of entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, dedicated to fostering innovation and collaboration among aspiring and established business leaders. Founded in early 2023 by Yohannes Taye, Abenazzer Taddese, and Tamrat Sultan, the Den began as informal coffee shop meetups and has since evolved into a vibrant hub for entrepreneurial exchange.

        The Den's mission is to create a free space where entrepreneurs can connect, share experiences, and discuss challenges and opportunities within Ethiopia's startup ecosystem. Weekly sessions feature discussions on various topics, including startup sacrifices, work-life balance, business planning, and negotiation skills. These gatherings attract a diverse audience, from high school students to seasoned entrepreneurs, and have expanded beyond Addis Ababa to include events in regional cities like Adama.

        In addition to weekly meetups, the Disruptors Den has launched several initiatives to support the entrepreneurial community. They have partnered with ALX Founders Academy to offer entrepreneurship training programs, resulting in over 1,000 graduates in the first cohort. The Den has also facilitated the creation of startups such as Qesem and Hulucare, the latter securing $10,000 as one of the winners in the Bimalab Ethiopia Insurtech Accelerator.

        Looking ahead, the Disruptors Den plans to introduce programs like Business Enawga, which will feature curated conversations between established and aspiring entrepreneurs, and Startup Digis, an annual showcase recognizing high-performing members. They are also developing a 'legacy points' system to measure and reward members' commitment, ensuring that opportunities are distributed based on active participation.

        Through these efforts, the Disruptors Den aims to inspire a pan-African mindset that fosters innovation to address continental challenges, positioning itself as a cornerstone of Ethiopia's entrepreneurial landscape.
